# NucleoESP8266WSN
We are writing an ESP8266 library for NucleoF401RE using the HAL Libraries.
We will use this library to implement a Wireless Sensor Network for CSSE4011 - Wireless Sensor Networks.
We will then use the two libraries together to produce some sort of useful sensor network around the University of Queensland
